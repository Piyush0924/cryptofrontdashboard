## Project Summary

### Problem Statement
Tracking cryptocurrency prices and understanding exchange rates can be complex due to the vast amount of data and the need for real-time information. Existing tools may not provide a comprehensive or user-friendly interface for these tasks. **CryptoDashboard** addresses these challenges by offering a streamlined platform where users can:

- View real-time price charts for various cryptocurrencies.
- Calculate exchange rates between different cryptocurrencies.
- Access a dynamically updated list of the top trending cryptocurrencies based on market cap.

### Approach
As a team of two developers, we focused on creating an intuitive and interactive application to simplify cryptocurrency tracking. Our approach involved the following core features:

- **Price Charts:** Real-time charts displaying cryptocurrency prices with options to compare multiple currencies.
- **Exchange Rates:** Calculation and display of exchange rates between different cryptocurrencies.
- **Top Cryptocurrencies:** A list of leading cryptocurrencies by market cap, updated dynamically.

### Technologies Used
- **Front-End:** Built using React for a responsive and modern design, with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **State Management:** Managed using Redux toolkit to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **API Integration:** Utilized CoinGeckoâ€™s API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
